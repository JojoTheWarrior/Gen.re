        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          <!-- TODO: Bold all the keywords -->
          A common but daunting problem that many musicians / composers face is figuring out how to discover and develop their own personalized style.

          Many musicians, in particular beginners, would like to gain inspiration by trying to compose in a variety of different genres.

          <br/><br/>

          Often, they can create a simple template melody - which is a great starting step - but not know how to expand upon that idea.

          Obviously, it's difficult to write music for a genre until you have learned how to write music for that genre - it may seem like an impossible circular task for these musicians.

        <h2>Gen.re's Solution</h2>
        <p>
          Thankfully, Gen.re proposes a solution:

          <br/><br/>

          All the user has to do is input their melody and select their desired genre.

          Then, Gen.re uses a Machine Learning (ML) model - trained by thousands of songs from that genre - to create a harmony for the inputted melody. 

          <br/><br/>
          
          This approach allows musicians to easily discover the variety of different paths that their melody can take and gain inspiration.

          Using modern ML technologies, Gen.re's solution is optimized, inexpensive, and effective.
